/*      Types of Functions in C

      Built in functions  : are also called library functions 

      - are functions which are already defined in the library of C language . Each built in function is meant
        to perform a specific task

        e.g

        printf() function is meant to print some text on screen
        scanf()  function is meant to read some value from the keyboard
        rand()  function is meant to generate some random number
        malloc() & calloc() function is meant to allocate memory locations at run time
        ralloc() function is meant to reallocate or resize an already allocated memory location
        free() function is meant to deallocate or free an already allocated memory location




    User Defined Function :

    if required we can also define our own functions ; which are called user defined functions.
    UDF are defined by programmers 

    Note  -  Functions may or may not accept parameters and may or may not return a value 

    Based on the presence and absence of parameters and return value , functions are again categorized into 4 categories

    - a function without parameters and without return value 
    - a function with parameters and without return value
    - a function wihout parameters and with return value
    - a function with parameters and with return value
